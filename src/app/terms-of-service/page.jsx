        increased fees if the fee is based on usage or other quantitative
        criteria or it may result in reaching the limits of use of the Service

      </h2>

        While providing the Service for third-party integration we generally do

        forwarded to us for resolution or our staff may otherwise assist in
        resolving end user issues.

        services is subject to separate contractual agreements with the
        providers of these third party services. Nothing in these Terms shall be
        construed as W4 Labs providing such third party services and the W4 Labs
        shall not be responsible for the quality or availability of such third
        party services. In the case of connections to DLT, virtual asset or
        cryptocurrency technology related services, there is no provision by the
        W4 Labs of any services related to these technologies, including the
        holding of virtual assets or cryptocurrencies or the provision of
        transaction services. In no event shall it be implied that the W4 Labs
        provides any services in the nature of payment, banking, investment
        services or services of a virtual asset service provider.{" "}
