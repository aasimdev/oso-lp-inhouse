  Report: **How to Detect Mobile Devices Using Cloudflare Redirect Rules**

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  ðŸ¤” **Understanding Mobile Device Detection with Cloudflare**

  &nbsp;

  Cloudflare provides a feature called Mobile Redirect [1]. This feature allows website owners to automatically redirect mobile device visitors to a mobile-optimized website or subdomain home page [1] [2]. By detecting the user agent string of the visitor's device, Cloudflare can determine whether the request is coming from a mobile device and apply the appropriate redirect rule.

  &nbsp;

  ðŸš€ **Implementing Mobile Device Detection with Cloudflare**

  &nbsp;

  To implement mobile device detection using Cloudflare redirect rules, you can follow these steps:

  &nbsp;

  1. Log in to your Cloudflare account and select the desired domain.
  2. Go to the Speed > Optimization > Other section of the Cloudflare dashboard [2].
  3. Under Mobile Redirect, select the subdomain that you would like to redirect from the dropdown list [2].
  4. Choose whether to Keep Path or Drop Path in the redirect [2] â†’ Keep Path will redirect all mobile requests to the same resource hosted on your mobile-optimized website [2].
  5. Save the changes and test the redirect to ensure it is working as expected.
